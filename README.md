# sql-data-warehouse-project
You are welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**
This project showcases how to design and implement a scalable data warehouse using SQL Server, complete with ETL pipelines, 
dimensional data modeling, and analytics-ready structures. Perfect for data professionals looking to modernize their data stack.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a Modern Data Warehouse using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) with SQL Server.

üìê Key Components:
Data Architecture: Implementing a layered Medallion approach for raw, cleansed, and curated data.

ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from ERP and CRM source systems.

Data Modeling: Designing star schemas with optimized fact and dimension tables for analytics.

Analytics & Reporting: Writing SQL-based queries and building dashboards to uncover business insights.

üéØ Ideal For:
This repository is a practical and portfolio-ready example for:

SQL Developers

Data Architects

Data Engineers

ETL Pipeline Developers

Data Modelers

Aspiring Data Analysts
